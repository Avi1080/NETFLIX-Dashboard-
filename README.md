# NETFLIX-Dashboard


Tableau Project   


This project aims to create a Netflix Dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of the content available on the platform. The dashboard focuses on visualizing key metrics such as:
Content Type Distribution: Showing the proportion of movies vs. TV shows.
Show Ratings: Displaying the distribution of shows across different age ratings (e.g., TV-MA, TV-14).
Show Count by Country: Mapping the geographical distribution of content production.
Show Count by Release Year: Analyzing the trend of content release over time.
Show Count by Genre: Identifying the most prevalent genres on the platform.
The dashboard also includes details about a specific show ("Round One"), providing a sample of the individual show information available. The overall goal is to present data in an accessible and insightful way, allowing users to understand the composition and trends of Netflix's content library.
